# Terms of Service
This repository is a collaborative tool for discussing the terms of service of the Internet of Things. 
The project is part of the MA thesis called "Objects of Research":http://objects-of-research.iohanna.com/

In my project, I imagine that as the IoT is a transition of the Internet from the digital to the physical, the terms of service would also do such transformation. Thus, the question is: How would the "terms and conditions" look like when the services are part of the physical world? Would our houses have Terms? Would we still have the chance to accept or decline them? To show this issue, I have created a dystopian object. The critical object is a mini printer which is constantly printing the terms and conditions of every device that connects to your network. However, it has no accept or reject button anymore. I imagine that the term of service that connected devices will have in the future could be similar to the terms of the digital services we use today. 

The sentences are based on Google's and Facebook's terms of services from July 2015 (http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/, https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms). I just replaced the name of the companies by "the house."

I belive that this object could serve as a tool to discuss in wich terms we want to adopt this technology in our houses. So the intention is to re-write the sentences. Feel free to fork and pull request these sentences, or even add new ones from services you use. (Funny fact: even GitHub's Terms of Service are not open).
